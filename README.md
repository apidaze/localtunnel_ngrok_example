APIdaze WebRTC Server Example
=============================
This folder contains all the files you'll need to create a simple server with APIdaze. You can copy these files where you wish.

Files and Folders
-----------------

- package.json - Provides project information allowing npm to find and install required modules.
- server.js - Server code.
- /public/ - Root folder for web server. Put your html files here and set up your own application.

Installing Required Modules
---------------------------

Type npm install in console.
This will read the package.json file to find and install the required modules including Express.
Required modules will go into a new 'node_modules' subfolder

Running the Server
------------------

Type node server in console.

Viewing the examples
--------------------

- In your WebRTC enabled browser, visit your server address including the port. By default port 8080 is used.
- http://localhost:8333 or http://youlocalip:8333, and invite mates to join
